# Introduction
Recursion is an important concept in computer science. It is a foundation for many other algorithms and data structures. However, the concept of recursion can be tricky to grasp for many beginners.

Before getting started with this card, we strongly recommend that you complete the binary tree and the stack Explore cards first.

In this Explore card, we answer the following questions:

- What is recursion? How does it work?
- How to solve a problem recursively?
- How to analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm?
- How can we apply recursion in a better way?

## Problems
### Principle of Recursion
- [Reverse String](/./344-reverse-string/)
- [Swap Nodes in Pairs](/./24-swap-nodes-in-pairs/)
